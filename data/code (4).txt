Scenario 2:
Your landlord or their family wants to move into the unit you are renting (N12)
Your landlord can evict you if they want the unit for their, or a family member's, personal use.
Official form for this scenario:
N12 - Notice to End your Tenancy Because the Landlord, a Purchaser or a Family Member Requires the Rental Unit
In this scenario:
* Landlords can apply for an eviction so that they, a close family member or a caregiver can move into the unit.
* A landlord could act in bad faith if they don't plan on occupying the unit, and instead evict you and then list the unit on the rental market for a higher price.
* Your landlord may have given you an N12 notice of eviction.
Landlord Requirements
1. Compensate you for one month of rent in the case that you move out or offer you another rental unit that is acceptable to you.
2. Give 60 days' notice using an N12 form for their application to the LTB to evict you. The date of termination in the notice must be a day before you are supposed to pay rent.
3. File an L2 with the LTB no later than 30 days after the termination date on the N12. Your landlord's application for eviction will prompt a hearing where you can defend your tenancy.
