Preventing Evictions in Toronto
A Handbook for Renters
Updated: May 2024

Recommended Actions
Connect with eviction prevention support services early to get information, advice and support.
See Renter Support Organizations on page 33 for more details.
Keep all communication with your landlord in writing. If your landlord calls you, ask them to communicate in writing. This can help legal workers support you and can provide evidence for a hearing if one takes place.
Attend the hearing if the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) notifies you that you have an eviction hearing - this is very important. Legal support is available for
renters that have eviction hearings through the Tenant Duty Counsel Program. Call Legal Aid Ontario at
416-979-1446 to learn more.
Talk with your renter neighbours, if applicable, and get organized. Sometimes landlords move to evict many renters at the same time. Communicating with your neighbours can help you support one another. Some buildings and neighbourhoods have renter associations that help support renters facing eviction. The Federation of Metro Tenants' Association (FMTA) Tenant Hotline can help connect you with local tenant associations at
416-921-9494.

Actions to Avoid
You do not need to move out if your landlord asks or tells you to move out verbally, in writing or through an eviction notice. You can only be evicted through an order for eviction issued by the LTB, generally after a hearing, which can take several months.
Avoid signing any documents or agreeing to move out until you get legal advice and support. You do not have to give in to a landlord's pressure to quickly make decisions or sign documents. Always talk with support
