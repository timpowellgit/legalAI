Scenario 3:
Your landlord is selling their property, which includes your unit (N12)
Your landlord cannot evict you to sell their property unless the buyer is moving into the property.
Official form for this scenario: N12 - Notice to End your Tenancy Because the Landlord, a Purchaser or a Family Member Requires the Rental Unit
In this scenario:

* Your landlord selling the property you rent is not a legal reason for eviction.
* You cannot be evicted because your landlord wants to sell or is selling the rental home.
* When a landlord sells a home, the lease or rental agreement is
transferred automatically to the new owner with the same conditions.
* New landlords cannot increase your rent and you do not need to sign a new lease or rental agreement.
* Your lease or tenancy agreement with your old landlord continues.
* You can be evicted only if the residential complex you reside in contains three or fewer residential units and the new owner, their immediate family or a caregiver is going to move into the rental home. If this is the case, the seller can give notice to evict you on behalf of the
buyer. You are entitled to one month's compensation (or can be offered another rental unit that is acceptable to you).
* 
Remember, you can only be evicted through an order for eviction issued by the LTB. It is recommended you get legal advice and information before signing any documents or moving out.
* Your landlord cannot have you evicted because the property is easier to sell if it is empty.
* Some landlords offer renters agreements to move out voluntarily for a sum of money.
* If the new owner, their immediate family or their caregiver does not move into the home for one year, or re-rents the home to someone else within the first year, this may be a bad faith eviction. If you have been evicted in bad faith, you may be able to receive compensation from your landlord through the LTB. Your closest Legal Aid Ontario legal clinic
or legal representative can assist you with this process.

Landlord Requirements
1. Have an agreement of purchase and sale for the residential complex or unit.
2. Compensate you either for one month of rent in the case that you move out or offer another unit acceptable to you.
3. Give 60 days' notice using an N12 form for their application to the LTB to evict you. The date of termination in the notice must be
a day before you are supposed to pay rent.
4. File an L2 with the LTB no later than 30 days after the termination date on the N12. If accepted, your landlord's application for eviction will prompt a hearing where you can defend your tenancy.
