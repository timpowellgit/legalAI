The Eviction Process in Ontario
An eviction is a formal procedure that is managed by the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) of Ontario. Every landlord must follow a series of steps to legally evict a renter. This handbook refers to these steps as phases, as outlined below.
If you have not sought legal advice at this point, you should do so as soon as possible. See page 33 for organizations that can help.
Regardless of the type of eviction notice you receive from your landlord, you do not need to leave your home immediately. You do not need to leave until you receive a formal order for eviction from the LTB or you agree to move out.
There are many types of evictions recognized under the Residential Tenancies Act (RTA). This handbook includes information on the following common situations:
* Arrears of rent (meaning behind on rent) (N4) (see page 19)
* Landlord's own use (N12) (see page 21)
* Purchaser's own use (N12) (see page 22)
* Demolition, renovation or conversion (N13) (see page 24)
Other types of evictions include:
* Persistent late payment (N8)
* Interfering with others, damage or overcrowding (N5)
* Illegal act or misrepresentation of income (if Rent-Geared-to-Income) (N6)
* Causing serious problems in the rental unit or residential complex (N7)
