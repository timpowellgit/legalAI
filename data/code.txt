Maintenance, Repairs and Other Landlord Responsibilities
Your landlord must keep your building and rental unit in a good state of repair, complying with all health, safety, housing and maintenance standards. Landlords are responsible for repairs even if the renter knew about problems before agreeing to rent the home.
Landlord Requirements
* Fix anything that breaks or does not work properly, such as a broken refrigerator, a clogged drain or leaking pipes.
* Get rid of pests, such as cockroaches or mice. Renters should work cooperatively with landlords and abide by any treatment plans to achieve pest removal.
* Track renter service requests
* Building owners must respond to urgent requests that impact vital services (heat, water, electricity, gas or a breach of security) within 24 hours and respond to all other service requests within seven days.
* Provide heat between September 15th and June 1st so that the temperature in the rental units is at least 21∞ Celsius according to City of Toronto by-laws.
If the building has air conditioning, the
landlord is required to turn it on between June 2nd and September 14th to maintain a maximum temperature of not more than 26∞C.
* Provide access to vital services such as hot and cold water, electricity, heat and fuel (such as natural gas). The landlord cannot shut off these services, even if the renter has not paid rent. Vital services may be temporarily shut off for the minimum period necessary to make repairs. Landlords must notify renters of the interruption of vital services.
The landlord and renter can agree in the lease that the renter will pay for these services as part of the rent or based on what the renter uses.

Actions You Can Take

include, but are not limited to, broken windows and doors, leaks, low or no heat and pests.
