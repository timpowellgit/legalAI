Deciding Whether to Fight the Eviction or Move Out
If you are a residential tenant and are starting to have issues with your landlord or rental property owner, you should try to resolve it before the eviction process starts. An eviction is a formal procedure that is managed by the LTB. Every residential landlord must follow
a series of steps to legally evict a residential tenant.
Deciding whether to fight an eviction or move out can be a very difficult decision, and many factors come into play as you consider your options, including:
* it can be difficult to have to find a new place at similar rent if you enter back into the rental market
* moving out may mean having to leave your community if you can't find another suitable unit
* the legal process can be long and difficult
* getting compensation for moving out (making a deal with your landlord) could help
Getting legal advice and support can help you make your decision on whether to challenge an eviction.
