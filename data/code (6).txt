Bad Faith Notices of Eviction
Recently, there has been an increase in landlords in Toronto who are using
notices of eviction in bad faith, meaning notices that are given out dishonestly and without the intention to follow through on the terms of the notice. For example, a landlord may claim that a relative is moving in, but then rents the unit for a higher rate after you have moved out.
If you believe that your landlord has used the notice in bad faith, you have one year to file an application with the LTB or two years if you were evicted because your landlord was doing renovations to your unit and didn't honour your right of first refusal. Bad faith evictions only apply to certain types of evictions where the renter is not at fault, such as N12 (see page 21) and N13 (see page 24).
You can file an application with the LTB by using a Form T5: Landlord Gave a  Notice of Termination in Bad Faith7. If the LTB determines that the landlord has acted in bad faith, there is a range of compensation that may be awarded.
There is a fee to file, but you can apply to have this fee waived if you meet the financial eligibility requirements. Refer to the Practice Direction on Evidence on the LTB website8 for directions on how to apply for a fee waiver.
