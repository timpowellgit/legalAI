Your Rights as a Renter
The rights identified in the RTA protect most residential tenants in Ontario from arbitrary eviction. These rights include:
* Your landlord cannot evict you on their own.
A landlord cannot evict you unless the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) issues an order for eviction. An order for eviction may take many months to obtain and is generally only issued after a hearing at the LTB.
* You have the right to an eviction hearing.
During a hearing at the LTB, you have the opportunity to explain why you should not be evicted or why your eviction should be delayed. Legal support is available to renters who have eviction hearings (see page 33 for a list of legal supports).
To get an eviction hearing, your landlord must first give you a written eviction notice using the proper forms from the LTB. Eviction notices on their own do not mean that you have to leave; they are only the first step in the eviction process.
* You can only be evicted for valid and specific reasons.
It is not enough that your landlord might desire to evict you.
