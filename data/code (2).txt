rent from the landlord, depending on the size of their building and whether the landlord has been ordered to do this work.
* Many renovations and repairs are not extensive enough for renters to be legally evicted. A building permit does not have to be issued prior to your landlord serving an N13 eviction notice.

Landlord Requirements
* Give you 120 days' notice in an N13 form for their application to the LTB for the eviction notice to be valid. The date of termination in the notice must be one day before you are supposed to pay rent.
* File an L2 - Application to End a Tenancy and Evict a Tenant with the LTB no later than 30 days after the termination date on the N13.
If accepted, your landlord's application for eviction will prompt a hearing where you can defend your tenancy.
* Give you compensation in most circumstances.
* Pay you an amount equal to one- or three- months' rent, depending on the building, or offer you another acceptable rental unit if your landlord is giving notice for Reason 1: Landlord intends to demolish the rental unit or the residential complex or Reason 3: Landlord intends to convert the rental unit or the residential complex into non-residential use.
* Offer you the right of first refusal. If your landlord is giving notice for Reason 2: Landlord requires the rental unit to be vacant to do repairs or renovations so extensive that they are required to get a building permit and the rental unit must be vacant to do the work, they must offer the right of first refusal.
