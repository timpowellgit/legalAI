Eviction Compensation
Compensation varies for different kinds of evictions. Compensation is a complicated matter, so it is
recommended that you call your closest Legal Aid Ontario legal clinic or legal representative.
Some landlords offer their renters higher compensation to speed up evictions or encourage renters to move out when they do not need to. These are often called "cash for keys" deals. The amount of compensation included in these agreements can vary. Your landlord
can offer you a cash for keys deal, but you never need to agree or sign one. The landlord may offer compensation alongside an N11 - Agreement to End the Tenancy form, which is a voluntary agreement to end a tenancy. You should be cautious of signing these agreements as they may bind you to agreeing that you move out by the date set out in
the form. It is recommended that you connect with a legal representative before signing these types of agreements.
You may want to speak to a realtor about how much your rental unit would cost with or without your tenancy
in place to assess a valid amount to negotiate.
