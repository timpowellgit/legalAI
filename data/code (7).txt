N6
Notice to Terminate a Tenancy Early: Illegal Act or
Misrepresentation of Income in a Rent-Geared-To-Income Unit
This notice applies in two situations: it applies when a tenant or a guest does something illegal on the property; it can also apply to people receiving Rent- Geared-to-Income (RGI) or other housing subsidies where the amount of rent is determined based on the reported income. It may be grounds for eviction if it is found that a renter is earning more income than is reported.

N7
Notice to End your Tenancy For Causing Serious Problems in the Rental Unit or Residential Complex
A renter or their guests have caused damage or serious problems for their landlord or other renters.

N8
Notice to Terminate Tenancy at the End of the Term
At the end of a lease the landlord can file for eviction for any of the following reasons:
* a renter has persistently paid rent late
* a renter no longer qualifies for subsidized housing
* the rental unit was part of an employment agreement and a renter's employment ended
* the tenancy was created in good faith as a result of an Agreement of Purchase and Sale for a proposed condominium unit, and the agreement has been terminated
* the unit was rented so the renter could receive therapeutic care and the agreed period of tenancy has ended.

N12
Notice to End your Tenancy Because the Landlord, a Purchaser or a Family Member Requires the Rental Unit
A landlord, landlord's family, someone buying a renter's rental unit, or the buyer's family wants to move in. Eligible family includes only:
* spouse
* child
* parent
* spouse's child
* spouse's parent
  * caregiver for any of the above (See page 21 for more information.)


N13
Notice to End Tenancy Because the Landlord Wants to Demolish the Rental Unit, Repair it or Convert it to Another Use
A landlord wants to tear down the building, convert it to different use or is planning to do extensive repairs or renovations which require the unit to be empty.
Renters have the right to dispute the notice at the LTB. If the landlord is doing extensive renovations, renters have the right to move back into the rental unit once
the renovations are completed. Renters must give the
landlord written notice telling them that they want to move back in. Renters must also keep the landlord informed in writing any time their address changes. (See page 24 for more information.)
